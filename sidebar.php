	<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
	<p>You are on the blog now. Itâ€™s stuff from the hearts and minds of Stonebriar staff, volunteers and guest authors. It is more people's views than anything else, but we wouldn't have let them author these posts if they didn't agree with the core beliefs we hold true.  This blog is a casual forum for polite, open discussion, not a platform for pronouncing doctrine. Know that what you read here is opinion and not the official position or teachings of the church.</p>
